# How to use
  You can go to [enginette](https://enginette.netlify.app) now to view the ~~most recent main branch preview~~ the website and start making engines! We are currently at version `0.0.5`
  
# How does this work?
  This project works by taking all of the required parameters and generating them into a [piranha](https://github.com/ange-yaghi/piranha) script and then launching it with the [client](https://github.com/enginette/enginette-client).
